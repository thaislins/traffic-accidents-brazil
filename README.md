> Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death, injury and hospitalization, resulting in high economic and social costs. According to the [World Health Organization’s Global Report Status Report on Road Safety 2015](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/), more than 1.2 million people die every year on the roads around the world, most of them living in poor countries. And most of these traffic deaths are predictable and could be prevented with relative ease. Traffic infractions, which result in tickets/fines, are indications of bad roadside practices that could be avoided to prevent accidents, and it can be inferred that locations where the most traffic fines are issued are usually places where the most accidents happen.

> In Brazil, for example, despite the recent adoption of a series of measures to improve road safety, it was registered more than 46,000 deaths due to traffic accidents in 2013 . The Federal Highway Police (Polícia Rodoviária Federal - PRF) in Brazil attends about de 70,000km of federal highways and is distributed throughout the national territory, combating crime, assisting citizens, supervising, assessing and attending to accidents.

> In January 2017 the PRF started to use a new system to record the occurrence of traffic accidents and fines. We will use these and other datasets to investigate and obtain important information regarding traffic accidents in Brazil.

> The datasets can all be found in [Accidents - PRF](https://www.prf.gov.br/portal/dados-abertos/acidentes/acidentes) and [Fines - PRF](https://www.prf.gov.br/portal/dados-abertos/infracoes). The datasets of accidents by occurrence from 2007 to 2018 will be used to show a general description of the amount of accidents during these years. And the datasets pertaining accidents by ocurrence and person from 2017 will be analyzed in more detail. Other than that, the datasets that describe fines that happened in 2017 will be inspected and any possible correlations between this and the accidents dataset will be explored.
